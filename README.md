ARM Cortex Microcontroller Project
Overview
This project utilizes an ARM Cortex microcontroller to interface with various peripherals including an OLED display, a Bluetooth module for UART communication, and a WCS current sensor. 
The microcontroller gathers data from these peripherals and displays relevant information on the OLED display. The Bluetooth module enables wireless communication, allowing users to monitor the system attributes remotely.

Features
OLED Display: Utilizes I2C communication to display real-time system attributes such as voltage, current, power, Amp-Hour, and Watt-Hour.
Bluetooth Module: Supports UART communication for wireless data transmission and remote monitoring of system attributes.
WCS Current Sensor: Provides accurate measurement of current flowing through the system.
Real-time Monitoring: Users can monitor system attributes remotely via Bluetooth communication.
Expandability: The project can be expanded to include additional sensors or functionality as required.
