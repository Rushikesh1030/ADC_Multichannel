ARM Cortex Microcontroller Project:-
This project utilizes an ARM Cortex microcontroller to interface with various peripherals including an OLED display, a Bluetooth module for UART communication, and a WCS current sensor. Additionally, it employs multiple channel ADC with DMA to measure attributes such as voltage, current, power, temperature, Amp-Hour, and Watt-Hour. The microcontroller gathers data from these peripherals and displays relevant information on the OLED display. The Bluetooth module enables wireless communication, allowing users to monitor the system attributes remotely.

Features
